## Introduction

This documentation details how Snyk Local Code Engine can be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes Cluster running version 1.16.0 - 1.21.5
- 3 nodes with the following specs:
  - CPU 32 cores
  - RAM 120GB
  - Disk 500 GB (>300GB Ephemeral Storage)
- Helm 3.8.0

# Getting Started

Snyk Code Local Engine is installed and configured with Helm.

Image Pull Secrets and Broker Settings are required for basic installation. We recommend that settings are configured in `values-customer-settings.yaml` to simplify upgrades and troubleshooting, making installation/updates as simple as:

```bash
helm upgrade <INSTANCE_NAME> code-<VERSION>.tgz -i -f values-customer-settings.yaml
```

`INSTANCE_NAME` can be a company name or another name meaningful to you. `VERSION` should match the Helm Chart `.tgz` archive. Make sure that you get correct path to the `values-customer-settings.yaml` configuration file - Snyk Code Local Engine cannot be installed without it.

If you would rather not include image pull secrets in `values-customer-settings.yaml`, they can be included as arguments when running the Helm chart:

```bash
helm upgrade <INSTANCE_NAME> code-<VERSION>.tgz -i -f values-customer-settings.yaml \
--set global.imagePullSecret.credentials.username="<SNYK_REGISTRY_USER>" \
--set global.imagePullSecret.credentials.password='<SNYK_REGISTRY_PASSWORD>'
```

The above commands installs (or if a release already exists, upgrades) Snyk Code Local Engine. If the deployment was successful you will be able to scan a project via the Snyk Web Portal using whichever SCM integration specified.

# Installation

## Enabling CLI and/or PR Checks

Snyk Code Local Engine services needs to be accessible from outside the cluster for CLI and/or PR checks to work. Deployment settings will vary depending on how the cluster is configured. In all cases, cluster-specific settings are an addition to the settings in [Getting Started](#getting-started).

Add the following to `values-customer-settings.yaml`:

```yaml
global:
  ingress:
    enabled: true
```

Further steps to enable CLI and/or PR Checks vary depending on your cluster - skip to the section that is relevant to you:

- [Cluster with Cloud Load Balancer](#cluster-with-cloud-load-balancer)
- [Cluster without Cloud Load Balancer / Self Hosted Cluster](#cluster-without-cloud-load-balancer)

## Cluster with Cloud Load Balancer

_Before reading this section, ensure Snyk Code Local Engine has been installed on your cluster._

Snyk Code Local Engine supports Load Balancers from AWS and GCP. The Load Balancer may be `external` (the default) or `internal` (extra configuration required).

If your cluster is deployed on AWS or GCP, make changes in `values-customer-settings.yaml` as described in [Enabling CLI and/or PR Checks](#enabling-cli-andor-pr-checks) and upgrade the release via `helm upgrade`.

This will instruct your Cloud Provider to provision a new Load Balancer for your cluster - by default an external Load Balancer is created and is allocated a dynamic IP address by your Cloud Provider. If an internal Load Balancer is needed (no access from the internet) follow the [Internal Load Balancer](#internal-load-balancer-additional-configuration) section.

The IP address for any DNS records is the `EXTERNAL-IP` of the `nginx-ingress-controller` `Service` which may be acquired via:

```bash
$ kubectl get svc <INSTANCE_NAME>-nginx-ingress-controller

> NAME                                        TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   ...
  <INSTANCE_NAME>-nginx-ingress-controller    LoadBalancer   x.x.x.x      x.x.x.x       ...
```

As this dynamic IP may change if released, if Snyk Code Local Engine is uninstalled and redeployed you _may_ have to update any DNS records that resolve to this dynamic IP. See the following section to [set a Static IP](#static-ip) for your cluster if required, or jump straight to [Configuring Local Engine URL](#configure-local-engine-url).

### Static IP

If you have a static IP from your Cloud provider, this may be added as follows:

#### GCP

- If using an `external` Load Balancer, reserve a new [external](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-external-ip-address#reserve_new_static) IP address. If an `internal` Load Balancer is required, reserve an [internal](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-internal-ip-address) IP address in the _same GCP zone as your cluster_, and follow [Internal Load Balancer Additional Configuration](#gcp-1) steps.

- Add the following to `values-customer-settings.yaml`, replacing `STATIC_IP_ADDRESS_HERE` with the **Public** IP Address:

```yaml
nginx-ingress-controller:
  service:
    loadBalancerIP: <STATIC_IP_ADDRESS_HERE>
```

- Execute ` helm upgrade <INSTANCE_NAME> code-<VERSION>.tgz -i -f values-customer-settings.yaml`

- [Configure Local Engine URL](#configure-local-engine-url) with your new static IP address.

#### AWS

- Allocating a static IP address requires the use of an external Network Load Balancer - this is not provisioned/managed within Snyk Code Local Engine. Follow the steps described in this [Amazon Support Topic](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/alb-static-ip/).

- [Configure Local Engine URL](#configure-local-engine-url) to point to the static IP address of the _Network Load Balancer_ once provisioned.

- If Snyk Code Local Engine is uninstalled and redployed the Network Load Balancer mapping may need to be re-created.

### Internal Load Balancer Additional Configuration

If an internal LoadBalancer is required annotations must be added to `values-customer-settings.yaml`. This is dependant on your Cloud provider. Either an internal DNS record or a static IP is recommended for this deployment model.

Snippets are provided, and are case-sensitive:

#### GCP

- Add the following to `values-customer-settings.yaml`:

```yaml
nginx-ingress-controller:
  service:
    annotations:
      networking.gke.io/load-balancer-type: "Internal"
```

- Execute ` helm upgrade <INSTANCE_NAME> code-<VERSION>.tgz -i -f values-customer-settings.yaml`

This resource will be allocated a dyanmic `internal` IP address and will not be reachable from the internet. If a static IP is also required, follow [Static IP instructions for GCP](#gcp).

#### AWS

- Add the following to `values-customer-settings.yaml`:

```yaml
nginx-ingress-controller:
  service:
    annotations:
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: "internal"
```

- Execute ` helm upgrade <INSTANCE_NAME> code-<VERSION>.tgz -i -f values-customer-settings.yaml`

This resource will be allocated a dyanmic `internal` IP address and will not be reachable from the internet. If a static IP is also required, follow [Static IP instructions for AWS](#aws).

### Configure Local Engine URL

_Note: requires Snyk Code Local Engine be installed on your cluster._

It is recommended to create a DNS record (either internal or external, depending on your deployment) to simplify the access of your installation. The IP address may be used directly if a DNS record is not created.

Add the following to `values-customer-settings.yaml` and upgrade Snyk Code Local Engine:

```yaml
global:
  ...
  localEngineUrl: <either your assigned DNS record or your IP address - for example, http://local-engine.domain or http:/10.170.1.40>
```

**If an IP address was previously provided to your Snyk representative, please update us with your new DNS record.**

### Checking Cluster Health

To check if everything works, run:

```bash
curl -L http://<LOCAL_ENGINE_URL>/
> 302 -> <LOCAL_ENGINE_URL>/status
```

and

```bash
curl http://<LOCAL_ENGINE_URL>/broker/healthcheck
```

and

```bash
curl http://<LOCAL_ENGINE_URL>/api/healthcheck
```

For the first check, the response should be: `"Snyk Code is healthy! üê∂"` - if not, insepct the data that is returned. Some pods may not be in a healthy state.

For the second, you should see something similar: `{"ok":true,"websocketConnectionOpen":true,"brokerServerUrl":"https://broker.snyk.io","version":"4.116.0"}`

For the third, you should see: `{"gitSha":"sha","ok":true}`

### Next Steps

After configuring and installing Snyk Local Code Engine, please **contact your Snyk representative with your Snyk Code Local Engine domain or static IP address so this may be configured on Snyk‚Äôs systems.**

## Cluster without Cloud Load Balancer/ Self Hosted Cluster

_Note: This section does not apply for clusters using Cloud Native Load Balancers. See [Cluster with Cloud Load Balancer](#cluster-with-cloud-load-balancer) for those instructions._

1. Make changes in `values-customer-settings.yaml` as described in [Enabling CLI and/or PR Checks](#enabling-cli-andor-pr-checks) if required.

2. Make the following changes to `values-customer-settings.yaml` and run `helm upgrade`:

```yaml
nginx-ingress-controller:
  service:
    nodePorts:
      http: <PORT>
    type: "NodePort"
```

Where `<PORT>` is any port that falls into Kubenetes NodePort's range (`30000` - `32767`). We recommend to restrict access to this IP address to only known safe sources.

1. Identify the `NODE_IP` of the `nginx-ingress-controller`'s pod. You can get it using:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=nginx-ingress-controller -l app.kubernetes.io/component=controller -o wide
```

_Note: Whilst any Node IP will allow a connection to Snyk Code Local Engine, this allows requests to go directly to NGINX without any additional node-to-node forwarding by Kubernetes._

1. Check if this setup was successful by running the [healthcheck steps](#checking-cluster-health). Your `IP/DNS` will be `<NODE_IP>:<PORT>`.

1. Contact your Snyk representative to configure your ingress IP and port on Snyk‚Äôs systems.

### Configure Local Engine URL - No Load Balancer/Self Hosted

_Note: This section does not apply for customers using Cloud Native Load Balancers. See [Configure Local Engine URL](#configure-local-engine-url) for those instructions._

If your nodes have static IP addresses, create an `A` record per node. Any requests to this domain will be received by the `NodePort` Kubernetes service, which routes the request to whichever pod runs `nginx-ingress-controller`.

If your nodes have dynamic IP addresses creating DNS records may be operationally complex - it is recommended to seek support within your organisation.

---

## Enabling TLS

_Note: A DNS record is required to enable TLS. See [Configure Local Engine URL](#configure-local-engine-url) or [Configure Local Engine URL - No Load Balancer/Self Hosted](#configure-local-engine-url---no-load-balancerself-hosted) for instructions._

After making any changes described in this section **please contact your Snyk representative.**

### Adding a Certificate

By default, the ingress endpoints are not secured by TLS. In order to secure them:
- a DNS record must be created,
- a certificate generated,
- the following changes made in the `values-customer-settings.yaml` file:

```yaml
global:
  ...
  ingress:
    ...
    host: "<HOST>"
    tls:
      enabled: true
      secret:
        ...
        key: |
          <KEY>
        cert: |
          <CERT>
```

Where `<HOST>` is the domain used when the TLS `<CERT>` and `<KEY>` were generated. The Helm value `global.localEngineUrl` should match `<HOST>`.

Read more about securing an ingress with TLS [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls) and TLS secrets [in general](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#tls-secrets).

### Self Signed Certificates

If using a self-signed certificate, append the `--insecure` option to any `snyk` commands, or provide the CA to `snyk` by setting `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. This [help article](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360000925358-How-can-I-use-Snyk-behind-a-proxy-) provides further information and support.

# Third Party charts

To further customise third party services integrated into Snyk Code Local Engine, explore the following examples:

- [Ambassador](https://github.com/emissary-ingress/emissary/tree/master/charts/emissary-ingress) - used for internal load balancing
- [Redis](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis) - used for an in-memory cache
- [Fluentd](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/fluentd) - used for logging

# Logging

Fluentd is used to aggregate all our services' logs into one file. Logs are written to the `/var/log/snyk/logs` directory and are available on the `fluentd` pod.

The log file is rotated at least once per-day. This file _may_ be rotated multiple times per day if the file exceeds the configured size limit `fluentd-umbrella.logrotate.fileMaxSizeInMb` (default `500`). The number of files `logrotate` keeps is `fluentd-umbrella.logrotate.filesToKeep` (default 14). When a file is rotated the date and time of rotation is added as a suffix to the file name.

Logrotate will validate that the number of log files is not above `fluentd-umbrella.logrotate.filesToKeep` by removing the oldest log file when the number of log files is equal to `filesToKeep`+1 files.

Current logs for Snyk Code Local Engine may be viewed by `tail`ing the `code.log` file. To view log entries in the past, interrogate the log file with date and time _after_ the timeframe you would like to inspect.

To fetch all Snyk Code Local Engine log files to current directory run:

```console
kubectl cp <your-namespace>/<your-release>-fluentd-0:/var/log/snyk/logs ./
```

To fetch log files for specific dates get the list of existing log files by runnning:

```console
kubectl exec -it on-prem-fluentd-0 -- ls -l /var/log/snyk/logs
```

Then copy the log file you want to fetch by running:

```console
kubectl cp <your-namespace>/<your-release>-fluentd-0:/var/log/snyk/logs/<file-name> ./<target-file-name>
```

_NOTE: It may take a few minutes to copy all files - add the `-v` option to `cp` for output when file(s) are copied._

# Uninstalling Snyk Code Local Engine

To uninstall/delete the `INSTANCE_NAME` resources:

```bash
helm delete `INSTANCE_NAME`
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release from the cluster. The `--purge` option may be used to delete all history if required.
